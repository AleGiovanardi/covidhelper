# CovidHelper

CovidHelper is a program inspired by Adrian Rosebrock tutorials and aims to become a reliable source of automated detection of CT and RX scans to find infections caused by COVID19. 

We can train a model, serialize and save to disk. We can then use load_module.py file to test if an image is positive or negative.
